## üé• Demo Video

*(This is the section where you can insert your demo. Record a short video (using Loom, QuickTime, etc.) showing the dashboard and you making a call, then upload it to YouTube or another video service. Take a screenshot for the thumbnail.)*

**To insert your video:**
1.  Upload your video to a platform like YouTube or Loom and get the link.
2.  Take an engaging screenshot of your demo to use as a thumbnail. Upload this image somewhere (e.g., in your GitHub repo).
3.  Replace `link_to_your_thumbnail_image.png` and `link_to_your_video` in the line below.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive Voice Response (IVR):** Greets callers and asks a series of qualifying questions.
-   **Speech-to-Text Capture:** Captures and understands the user's spoken responses in real-time.
-   **Rule-Based Conversational Flow:** Guides the user through a predefined set of questions (name, age, reason for call).
-   **Live Call Forwarding:** Simulates routing the call to a human agent by forwarding it to a number of your choice.
-   **Real-Time Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard that displays captured call logs as they happen.
-   **API Test Simulation:** A one-click button on the dashboard to simulate a full call flow, demonstrating the backend logic and real-time UI updates without making a phone call.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
-   **Cloud Communications:** Twilio (Voice API, TwiML, Phone Numbers)
-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
